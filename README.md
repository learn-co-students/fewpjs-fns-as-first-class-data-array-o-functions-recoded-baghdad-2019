cd # JavaScript Functions as First Class Data: Array of Functions

## Learning Goals

- Create a JavaScript function that loops through a function `Array`

## Introduction

Since functions in JavaScript are "first-class" objects, it means they can be
treated like any other data type in JavaScript (`Number`, `String`, et al.).  A
fun way to experience this truth is to load up an `Array` of `Functions` and
then call each `Function`.

### Create a JavaScript Function That Loops Through a Function `Array`

Let's create an `Array` of dog-care functions so that we can report on the
activities we take in caring for Byron the Poodle.

When this program runs, it should print out:

```txt
console.log("Wake Byron the poodle");
console.log("Leash Byron the poodle");
console.log("Walk to the park with Byron the poodle");
console.log("Throw the frisbee for Byron the poodle");
console.log("Walk home with Byron the poodle");
console.log("Unleash Byron the poodle");
```

Start by creating a function for every activity that you see listed above:

For example:

```js
function wakeDog() {
  console.log("Wake Byron the poodle");
}
...
```

But wait, if we write it in this way, all of our uses of this function will be
for `Byron the poodle`. Let's _generalize_ now and make each function take a
`dogName` and `dogBreed` parameter. Thus:

```js
function wakeDog(dogName, dogBreed) {
  console.log(`Wake ${dogName} the ${dogBreed}`);
}
...
```

**Additionally**: Each function should **return** the string that it creates.
That is, we should create a `String`, log it to the console (using
`console.log()`), and return that `String`.

Continue writing _"generalized"_ functions for:

- `wakeDog`
- `leashDog`
- `walkToPark`
- `throwFrisbee`
- `walkHome`
- `unleashDog`

Each function's implementation will be a generalized invocation of
`console.log()`.

## Create the Array o' Functions

Next, create our "Array o' Functions!"

Create a variable called `routine`. This variable will be an `Array` all of the
functions we've just defined.

Note that this array should hold _references_ to each of the functions.

## Create a Function to Process the Array o' Functions

Lastly, create the function called `exerciseDog` that will take in two
arguments:

- `dogName`
- `dogBreed`

In the `exerciseDog` function, your goal is to call every function in the `routine` array with the `dogName` and `dogBreed`, and return a **new array** with
the return values from each of those function calls.

To break that down into steps, `exerciseDog` should:

- **Iterate** over the `routine` array to get access to each function in the array
- **Call** each function in the array, passing the `dogName` and `dogBreed`
  received by `exerciseDog()` to each function when calling it
- Store the return value of each function's call in a **new array**
- Return that **new array** from `exerciseDog`

There are several ways of implementing the `exerciseDog` function; what's
important is that you are able to iterate over the functions in the `routine`
array and return a new array with the return values after calling each function.
Think about what array methods can help you accomplish that goal.

## Conclusion

This lab demonstrates the power of `Function`s as first-class data. We can
stack them up in `Arrays` or assign them inside of `Objects` or save them to
variables, or iterate over them. Instead of _merely_ having `Array`s of
`String`s and other familiar items, we can stuff them with _work_. And that's
nothing short of amazing!
